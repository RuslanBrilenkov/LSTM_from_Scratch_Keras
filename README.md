# LSTM_from_Scratch_Keras

This repository reconrds my journey to the ML-generated story, based on "Alice in Wonderland", written by Lewis Carroll.

For more information about the principles of LSTM and this project, please take a look [here](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/a-story-generator-using-lstm-inside-recurrent-neural-network-rnn-f823b295571d)

## The goal: 
Build a Recurrent Neural Network using Keras (with Tensorflow backend) from scratch using to LSTM algorithm to generate text.
